Generate and embed dynamic multi step forms. Divide longer forms into small steps for better usability and more form submits.

Forms can be embedded on any page or post with shortcodes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Where's the settings page?
The global settings can be found in your WordPress "Settings" > "Multi Step Form". These settings include styling options and general options. Also, each form has its own settings (e.g. mail settings), which can be found at the \"Settings\"-tab on top of the drag & drop builder.

How can I add a form to my page or post?
Forms are embedded with shortcodes. The shortcodes can be found at the form list view when clicking "Multi Step Forms" in your WordPress menu on the left. The shortcode for your first form with the id 1 is [wizard id="1"].
